Microservices are great, and they offer us lots of options for how we can build, scale and evolve our applications. On the face of it, they should also help us create much more secure applications - the ability to protect in depth is a key part of protecting systems, and microservices make this much easier. On the other hand, information that used to flow within single processes, now flows over our networks, giving us a real headache. How do we make sure our shiny new microservices architectures aren’t less secure than their monolithic predecessor.

In this talk, I outline some of the key challenges associated with microservice architectures with respect to security, and then looks at approaches to address these issues. From secret stores, time-limited credentials and better backups, to confused deputy problems, JWT tokens and service meshes, this talk looks at the state of the art for building secure microservice architectures.",

Fast forward to today, and now we have NoSQL databases, microservices, message queues and brokers, HTTP web services and more that don't (and shouldn't) support any kind of distributed transaction.

In this session, we'll look at how to implement coordination between non-transactional resources using Pat's paper as a guide, with examples in Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Service Bus, and Azure SQL Server. We'll look at a real-world example where a codebase assumed everything would be transactional and always succeed, but production proved us wrong!

So, what if things were different,and programming infrastructure was more like real programming, with real programming languages like TypeScript? What if you defined Lambda functions by actually writing lambdas, created abstractions using complex types, and could take advantage of existing tools for modularity, linting, refactoring and testing?

Enter Pulumi, an open-source deployment engine which enables all these things using TypeScript, Python or Go!

In this talk, we'll look at how you can write TypeScript code using Pulumi to provision traditional cloud infrastructure, manage Kubernetes and build portable ""serverless"" applications - all with minimal YAML in sight!

Starting off at whispers, we’re now starting to hear it as a deafening roar as more and more developers write about it, talk about it, share it and start using it. In the world of front end, I see it everywhere I turn and am excited as I start to use it in my own projects.

But what does this new CSS specification mean for software developers, and why should you care about it? In the world of tech today, we can do so many amazing things and use whatever language we choose across a wide range of devices and platforms. Whether it’s the advent of React and React Native, or frameworks like Electron, it’s easier than ever to build one app that works on multiple platforms with the language we know and work with best. The ability to do this also expands to styling apps on any platform using CSS, and therefore being able to utilise the magical thing that is
CSS Grid.

The reason CSS Grid is gaining so much attention, is because it’s a game changer for front end and layouts. With a few simple lines of code, we can now create imaginative, dynamic, responsive layouts (yep, I know that’s a lot of buzz words). While a lot of people are calling this the new ‘table layout’, grid gives us so much more, with the ability to spread cells across columns and rows to whatever size you choose, dictate which direction new items flow, allow cells to move around to fit in place and even tell certain cells exactly where they need to sit.

While there is so much to worry about when developing an app, CSS Grid means that you can worry less about building the layout on the front end, and more about making sure the back end works well. Let me show you how the magic works.",

In this talk, Steve will explore how we can build .NET Core applications that make HTTP requests and rely on downstream services, whilst remaining resilient and fault tolerant.

This session will focus on some of the improvements which have been released in .NET Core and ASP.NET Core 2.1, such as IHttpClientFactory and the new, more performant SocketHttpHandler. Steve will identify some HTTP anti-patterns and common mistakes and demonstrate how we can refactor existing code to use the new HttpClientFactory features.

Next, Steve will demonstrate other HTTP tips and tricking, including Polly; a fantastic resilience and transient fault handling library which can be used to make your applications less prone to failure.

I knew what a SHA256 hash was (sort of) but I didn't know how it was created, nor that it didn't completely protect some of my data. I knew these things were important, but I never understood how they could apply to the types of applications I was building at the time. All of this changed as I put together the first two volumes of The Imposter's Handbook.

I get to build a lot of fun things in my new position at Microsoft and I've been surprised at how often I use the things I've learned. Avoiding an obvious performance pitfall with Redis, for instance, because I understood the Big-O implications of the data structure I chose. Going back to ensure that a salt was added to a hash which stored sensitive data for an old client and, most importantly, discouraging a friend from trying to solve a problem that was very clearly NP-Complete.

In this talk I'll show you some of the fun things I've learned (like mod(%) and remainder being different things) and how I've applied them to the applications I create for my day job. You might know some of these concepts, or maybe you don't - either way: hopefully you'll leave with a few more tools under your belt to help you do your job better.has grown exponentially over the years, in both market size and developer frustration.
 
In this talk I will walk you through my first few months as an Azure Cloud Developer Engineer, tasked with getting to know Azure, from scratch, while building compelling applications with it. My job is two-fold: I get to show you why Azure is interesting and I then get to tell the Azure product team why it's not. This can be stressful. It can also be quite fun.

Billions of people tuned in live to watch Apollo 11 land on the moon, but behind Armstrong’s ‘one small step’ lay a decade of astonishing innovation. The Apollo programme wasn’t just about aerospace engineering; it was also responsible for revolutionary new approaches in project management and quality control; new ways of thinking about testing strategies and communications - not to mention delivering a completely bespoke set of hardware and software components that would play a vital role at every stage of the programme.

As we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the moon landings, let’s take a look back at the technology, processes and practises behind the Apollo programme - and how many of those techniques are still relevant today. What is ‘all-up testing’, and how does it apply to modern software development? Who was the CAPCOM - and what can they teach us about product ownership? How do you manage a distributed team of nearly half a million people? How do you manage scope creep when you’re working to a hard deadline with the whole world watching you?

This should come as no surprise to software engineers: this is, after all, documentation for a system that models a complex domain, and has been in use for over 40 years now, going through numerous redesigns over time.

As such, D&D rules make for a great exercise in domain modelling. In this talk, I will take you along my journey attempting to tame that monster. We will use no magic, but a weapon imbued with great power, F#; practical tips and tricks for the Adventurer on the functional road will be shared.

Does every service need to have a list of all our users? Who knows what users have permissions to the entities within the micro service? What happens if my REST endpoint needs to include data from a graph that includes other services to make it responsive? And I am not breaking the boundary of my service when all of this data leaves my service boundary in response to a request?

Naive solutions result in chatty calls as each service engages with multiple other services to fulfil a request, or in large message payloads as services add all the data required to process a message to each message. Neither scale well.

In 2005, Pat Helland wrote a paper ‘Data on the Inside vs. Data on the Outside’ which answers the question by distinguishing between data a service owns and reference data that it can use.

Large frontend projects suffer from all of the same problems of other software projects with the same characteristics:
Communication and coordination overhead
Speed of delivery
Large quantum size
Low productivity 

These factors are growing concerns for companies as productivity and speed of delivery is nowadays crucial for success in this competitive landscape

A common way of solving many of these issues in software projects is the microservices approach.

Today a similar approach of applying this same pattern to the frontend is being popularized and is commonly nominated as micro-frontends.

However this approach has many fallacies because of frontend specific characteristics:
- The performance cost of loading many independent applications
- The need for a common visual language and experience
- The browser is a monolithic runtime 

Description
This talk will be about the problems of large frontend projects and how to scale them in a way that balances team autonomy with performance and productivity

I’ll talk about how at farfetch we’re progressively refactoring our frontend to multiple independent applications, and the strategies we’re using to make sure that despite having many applications made by different independent and geographically distributed teams we still can deliver a performant and consistent product to the end user.

Full Description

Join me for this session and I will show you how with just a few lines of code, you can make your applications much more resilient and reliable. Let me tell you more… 

Almost all applications now depend on connectivity, but what do you do when the infrastructure is unreliable or the remote system is down or returns an error? Does your application grind to a halt or just drop that single request? What if you could recover from these kinds of error, maybe even so quickly it won’t be noticed? 
 
With Polly your application can easily tolerate transient faults and longer outages in remote systems or infrastructure.  

At the end of this hour you will know how to use all the features of Polly to make your application a rock solid piece of work. 

We’ll start with the simple but very powerful Retry Policy which lets you retry a failed request. If simple retries are not good enough for you, there is a Wait and Retry policy which introduces a delay between retries, giving the remote service time to recover before being hit again. Then I show you how to use the circuit breaker for when things have really gone wrong and a remote system is struggling under too much load or has failed. If all these attempts are unsuccessful and you are still not getting through to the remote system, you can return a default response or execute arbitrary code to call for human help (or restart the cloud) with the fallback policy. 

That takes care of what you can do when things go wrong, but Polly also lets you take proactive steps to keep your application and the services it depends on healthy.  

To get you started with proactive strategies, you will learn how caching can be used to store and return responses from an in-memory or distributed cache without having to hit the remote server every time. Or you can use bulkhead isolation to marshal resources within your application so that no one struggling part can take down the whole. Finally, I’ll show you how to fail quickly when your application is in danger of being overloaded or the remote systems is not responding in a timely fashion, this is done with the bulkhead isolation and the timeout polices.   

Oh, and did I mention Polly is a .NET Standard library so it will work on any application you can think of! Join me for an hour, and your applications will never be the same. ",

To work effectively with this kind of system, we need to answer some fundamental questions: why was it built this way in the first place? What's happened over the years it's been running in production? And, most importantly, how can we develop our understanding of legacy codebases to the point where we're confident that we can add features, fix bugs and improve performance without making things worse?

Dylan worked on the web application stack at Spotlight (www.spotlight.com) from 2000 until 2018 - first as a supplier, then as webmaster, then as systems architect. Working on the same codebase for nearly two decades has given him an unusual perspective on how applications go from being cutting-edge to being 'legacy'. In this talk, he'll share tips, patterns and techniques that he's learned from helping new developers work with a large and unfamiliar codebase. We'll talk about virtualisation, refactoring tools, and how to bring legacy code under control using continuous integration and managed deployments. We'll explore creative ways to use common technologies like DNS to create more productive development environments. We'll talk about how to bridge the gap between automated testing and systems monitoring, how to improve visibility and transparency of your production systems - and why good old Ctrl-Alt-Del might be the secret to unlocking the potential of your legacy codebase.",

While Java has grown enormously over the years, the fundamentals have stagnated.

The motivation for this talk and underlying project, was the following question: why is Java, with it’s 20 years of age, and (at least)6 billion running JVM’s not a major player in the video-game development universe?

#####TL;DR;
So everybody knows the Doom games, right? Every new installment brought brand new ideas, and groundbreaking graphics. But more importantly, they brought the source code of the prior installment to the public eye.

Naturally people have played and hacked the code to oblivion, as much as they played the games themselves. And I have the honor to be one of those people.

I (naively) endeavored to port the Doom 3 C++ code to the fantabulous Java. In doing so, I hoped to learn, among other things, more about 3D graphics.
...what I didn't expect though, was for djoom3(cool name huh!) to teach me more about Java!?

Aside from the basic game development intro, this talk focuses on the following:
- Some areas where Java should learn from it's nemesis, C++
- Other areas where the student(Java) becomes the master(C++)
- And some promises that were made, but never keptWhile Ja",

Load balancing, traffic management, fault tolerance, end-to-end monitoring, dynamic routing and secure communication could all be applied and controlled centrally. That's a service mesh.

In this session I'll cover the major features of a service mesh using Istio - which is the most popular technology in this space. I'll show you what you can do with a service mesh, how it simplifies application design and also where it adds complexity. My examples will range from new microservices designs to legacy monoliths, and you'll see what a service mesh can bring to different types of application.",

After 3D printing the parts I moved onto the electronics but this requires building a bespoke board that often needs software changes to set-up and configure.  So my version uses off the shelf IOT parts and connects via Bluetooth to a Xamarin .Net application for changing the settings and configuring on Kayden’s phone.

- Platforms Kotlin is great for
- Object Oriented Implementations in Kotlin
- Extended Features
- Features Kotlin has that C# doesn't
- A demo Android application in Kotlin vs a Xamarin.Android app in C#

In the end you will leave with a foundational knowledge of Kotlin and its capabilities to build awesome apps with less code. You should feel comfortable comparing C# applications to Kotlin applications and know where to find resources to learn even more!",
