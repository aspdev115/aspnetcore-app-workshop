# Challenges

Now that we've built the basic site, it's time for some challenges. Below are a list of feature ideas that take advantage of other ASP.NET Core features:

## Identity
 - Add local user accounts using ASP.NET Core Identity instead of Google or Twitter auth

## Logging
- Add 3rd party logger (serilog) and disable built in console logging
- Add `ILogger` support to `ApiClient` implementation to log all outgoing http requests.

## Images
 - Add image upload to `Speaker` entity
 - Resize the image using `ImageSharp`

## Caching
 - Add various caching to front end site
    - Memory cache, distributed cache, response caching

## TagHelpers
- Render Markdown for the session Abstract (instead of HTML) using a custom markdown tag helper.

## Data
 - Change database provider to [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)
 - Change database provider to [MySql](https://www.mysql.com/)
 
## Testing
 - Write unit tests for the backend
 - Write unit tests for the FrontEnd Razor pages


## FrontEnd Features
- Make the site work for multiple conferences
 - Add conference date
 - Make the home page show upcoming conferences 
 - Move agenda to separate page
- Make the names slugs instead of using IDs in the urls to navigate entities
- Add admin pages to manage:
  - Tracks
  - Attendees
  - Conferences
  - Sessions
  
## BackEnd Features
 - Add date filtering to the backend APIs
